# Memory Allocator Simulator

## Informations

Student project in first year at the engineering school [ESIR](https://esir.univ-rennes1.fr/)

The purpose of this project is to simulate a simple memory allocator in python to understand how a memory allocator works and train with graph algorithms.

You can create processes and assign resources to them, show a graph of dependencies and find deadlocks.
